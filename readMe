this library is designed on Raspberry Pi.
but i designed the overall structure was based on linux as a whole, maybe the others can be used.

the "ads1118.h" is header and main.c is example.

"SPIdev.h" is just similar to "I2Cdev.h" and i thought someone need this.
So i made and upload.

-----------------warning-------------
i found in my code, there are some problem.
so i am fixing now. do not use this until this warning is removed.
